# Testing

### Testing was a crucial part of my process to ensure my website performed as well as possible. Below I have detailed the steps I took to test my site comprehensively. I successfully tested my website in the following browsers: Chrome, Safari & Firefox. With the help of classmates and slack, I am confident my website works responsively on all popular devices.


# Validation Testing
   * HTML: No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator. Files tested:

# Issues and Bugs 
 * I was getting warnings in jshint about ES6. Resolution found to clear these.
   * jsHint /jshint esversion:6/ added to the top of js file, removed warnings.
* Timer and time liner didn't run in sync. Corrected SetInterval. (JavaScript in easy steps by Mike McGrath)
* Timer didn't start counting from 20 decreasing straight away, showed at first previous answer time result.
   * Added timeCount.textContent = time to function startTimer. Solved this issue.

 * My biggest issue is still grammar mistakes. Need to pay more attention.
